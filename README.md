# Generate your API documentation

Bump is a Continuous Documentation Platform: it lets you keep your API doc always synchronized with your codebase. With this [Github Action](https://github.com/actions) you can automatically generate your API reference (with changelog and diff) on [Bump](https://bump.sh) from any [OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) or [AsyncAPI](https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi) file.

## Usage

Start by creating a documentation on [Bump](https://bump.sh). Then add this workflow to your GitHub project:

```
name: Deploy documentation

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  deploy-doc:
    name: Deploy API doc on Bump
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Deploy API documentation
        uses: bump-sh/github-action@0.2
        with:
          id: <BUMP_DOC_ID>
          token: ${{secrets.BUMP_TOKEN}}
          file: doc/api-documentation.yml
```

Important: [actions/checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout) has to be called **before this action**.


## Inputs

* `id` (required): Documentation id. Can be found in the documentation settings on https://bump.sh

  * Your documentation token can be found in the documentation settings on https://bump.sh. 
  * In your GitHub repository, click Settings, and then Secrets.
  * Click the button "New repository secret" and add your bump token. In the above example, the secret is called BUMP_TOKEN).
